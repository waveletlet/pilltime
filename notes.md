## Exponential decay
y(t) = a Ã— e^kt

Where y(t) = value at time "t"
a = value at the start
k = rate of growth (when >0) or decay (when <0)
t = time

If I know the half life and starting quantity, first need to solve for k:

````
y / a = e^kh
ln(y / a) = kh
ln(y / a) / h = k
a = starting quantity
y = half starting quantity = a/2
h = half life
````

In go terms: `k := math.Log(a/2/a) / h`
Plug that into: `Y := a * math.Exp(k * t)`

But found a much more straightforward formula for half life:
Y = a * 2^-(t/h)
Y := a * math.Exp2(-t/h)



Need to decide at what value of y is it ~0? Or use rule of thumb: after 5
half-lives considered gone
- Test with 25 mg w/ 24h half life: at 5 half lives it's ~0.78 mg. Some people
  say a dose that small will still affect them, which will also depend on the
  drug in question and person in question. 10 half-lives is about 1/1000
  original dose, I'll arbitrarily go with that as a default "0" for cumulative
  calculations, but have it changeable.
  - Still have to play with if I want the variable to be in terms of drug
    quantity (and if that, absolute or relative to original dose), or half lifes

## Models
- Dose
  - Dosage
  - ScheduledTime time.DateTime
    - ScheduledTime = TakenTime until interactive reminder timer functional
  - TakenTime time.DateTime
  - ZeroTime time.DateTime

- Dosage
  - Qty float? bignum?
    - Probably can store as float and do calcs as bignum
  - QtyUnits string
  - Chemical struct

- Chemical 
  - HalfLife time.Duration
  - EmptyStomachOK yes/no/doesn't matter
    - Don't need to implement until scheduling system differentiates between
      meal times and nonmeal times

- DrugSchedule
  - Dose
  - BeginTime time.DateTime
  - EndTime time.DateTime
  - Interval/schedule type
    - (see Calendula schedule options)

- PatientRoutine
  - WakeTime
  - SleepTime
  - Meals (includes snacks)
    - MealTimes
  - Unavailable
    - Like sleep times but more flexible for misc other reasons someone
      predictably can't take a dose (ex. fasting, commute, class)
